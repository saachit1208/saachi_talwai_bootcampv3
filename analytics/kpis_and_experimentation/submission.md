## User Story

### Product: Youtube Music

YouTube Music has become an integral part of my life over the past few years. I tansitioned from being a Spotify Premium user to solely using Youtube Music. This switch was influenced by my peers. 
As conversations around me echoed the superiority of YouTube Music and its recommendations, it piqued my curiosity until I finally made the switch. Since it has around the same monthly subscription fee as Spotify Premium, it made my decision easier. 
In my opionion it does have a stronger recommendation algorithm than Spotify, since it has a lots more data about your preferences to learn from, right from when Youtube Video started. 
Over time the music app has seamlessly made its way into my lifestyle, becoming my ultimate music companion for various activities and moods.


#### Moods and Preferences:
YouTube Music excels in aligning with my daily rhythm, especially as I work remotely. It serves as the constant background, accompanying me throughout the day. From the energizing tunes that kick-start my mornings to the calming melodies that wind down my evenings, the app seamlessly adapts to my ever-changing preferences. During the day, it offers tracks that match my pace, keeping me focused and invigorated. As dusk settles in, the transition to tranquil and meditative music perfectly complements my winding-down routine, aiding relaxation before bedtime.

#### Discovering New Artists:
It's not just a music player; it's my gateway to discovering new artists and genres. The personalized recommendations introduce me to musicians I might have otherwise missed, broadening my musical horizons and constantly surprising me with delightful finds.

#### Curation:
The platform also empowers my creative side through playlist curation. Crafting playlists tailored to specific moments or emotions has become a delightful outlet. Whether it's curating a LoFi playlist for a peaceful afternoon or compiling tracks for an upbeat workout session or a vibrant house party, YouTube Music consistently delivers the ideal soundtrack for diverse occasions. It's not just a music app; it's a companion that understands my musical preferences, making each moment more vibrant and enjoyable.

#### Lyrics Integration:
A notable feature I appreciate in YouTube Music is the availability of lyrics for a wide range of songs. 
This feature provides the opportunity to view song lyrics directly within the app interface. 
Accessing lyrics while listening to tracks allows for a more immersive experience, enabling me to follow along with the song's words and gain a deeper understanding of the music.
