## User Story

Product: Youtube Music

YouTube Music has become an integral part of my daily routine over the past few years. I was previously a Spotify Premium user. This switch from Spotify to Youtube Music was influenced by my peers. 
As conversations around me echoed the superiority of YouTube Music and its recommendations, it piqued my curiosity until I finally made the switch. Since it has the same monthly subscription fee as Spotify Premium, it made my decision to switch easier. 
In my opionion it does have a stronger recommendation algorithm than Spotify, since it has a lots more data to learn from, right from when Youtube Video started. 
Over time the music app has seamlessly integrated into my lifestyle, becoming my ultimate music companion for various activities and moods.

### Daily Engagement:
It's a part of my daily rhythm; I wake up to its melodies, often tuning in while I prepare breakfast or cook meals. The diverse selection of tracks keeps me motivated and energized throughout the day, aligning perfectly with my tasks and productivity.

### Mood and Preferences:
The beauty of YouTube Music lies in its ability to cater to my ever-changing preferences. During the day, it offers upbeat tunes that match my pace, keeping me focused and enthusiastic. As evening approaches, the app gracefully transitions, offering tranquil and meditative music that soothes and relaxes, complementing my winding-down routine before bedtime.

### Discovering New Artists:
It's not just a music player; it's my gateway to discovering new artists and genres. The personalized recommendations introduce me to musicians I might have otherwise missed, broadening my musical horizons and constantly surprising me with delightful finds.

### Curation:
Creating playlists has become a creative outlet, allowing me to curate collections tailored to specific moments or emotions. Whether it's an energizing workout session, medidative music to sleep, or a house party, YouTube Music has the perfect soundtrack ready for every occasion.
In essence, YouTube Music has seamlessly woven itself into my life, adapting to my daily rhythm, moods, and activities. It's not just a music app; it's a companion that understands my musical preferences, making every moment more vibrant and enjoyable.
