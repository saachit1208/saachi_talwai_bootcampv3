## User Story

### Product: Youtube Music

YouTube Music has become an integral part of my life over the past few years. I tansitioned from being a Spotify Premium user to solely using Youtube Music. This switch was influenced by my peers. 
As conversations around me echoed the superiority of YouTube Music and its recommendations, it piqued my curiosity until I finally made the switch. Since it has around the same monthly subscription fee as Spotify Premium, it made my decision easier. 
In my opionion it does have a stronger recommendation algorithm than Spotify, since it has a lots more data about your preferences to learn from, right from when Youtube Video started. 
Over time the music app has seamlessly made its way into my lifestyle, becoming my ultimate music companion for various activities and moods.

#### Daily Engagement:
It's a part of my daily rhythm; Since I'm remote I always have it playing while I work. I wake up to its melodies, often tuning in while I prepare breakfast or cook meals. The diverse selection of tracks keeps me motivated and energized throughout the day, aligning perfectly with my tasks and productivity.

#### Mood and Preferences:
The beauty of YouTube Music lies in its ability to cater to my ever-changing preferences. During the day, it offers upbeat tunes that match my pace, keeping me focused and enthusiastic. As evening approaches, the app gracefully transitions, offering tranquil and meditative music that soothes and relaxes, complementing my winding-down routine before bedtime.

#### Discovering New Artists:
It's not just a music player; it's my gateway to discovering new artists and genres. The personalized recommendations introduce me to musicians I might have otherwise missed, broadening my musical horizons and constantly surprising me with delightful finds.

#### Curation:
Creating playlists has become a creative outlet, allowing me to curate collections tailored to specific moments or emotions. Whether it's an energizing workout session, LoFi music that calm me, or a house party playlist, YouTube Music has the perfect soundtrack ready for every occasion.
It's not just a music app; it's a companion that understands my musical preferences, making every moment more vibrant and enjoyable.

#### Lyrics Integration:
Additionally, a notable feature I appreciate in YouTube Music is the availability of lyrics for a wide range of songs. This feature provides the opportunity to view song lyrics directly within the app interface. Accessing lyrics while listening to tracks allows for a more immersive experience, enabling me to follow along with the song's words and gain a deeper understanding of the music.
